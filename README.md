# GameOfLife
Joseph Conway's Cellular Automata, The Game of Life.

The Game of Life illustrates the complexity and beauty that may arise given a simple set of constraints which govern the birth and death of cells on a grid.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
1. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
1. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
